## Tools

- https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/tools.html
- Cambalache: Tool for designging UIs https://gitlab.gnome.org/jpu/cambalache
  - Nice Tool but to me (robert) it seemed not really user friendly. But it is still being worked on
- GLADE: Tool for designing UIs. https://glade.gnome.org/
  - Unfortunately its only useful for GTK3. But it is a nice tool and its possible to convert the UI to GTK4 with some manual work with the help of gtk4-builder-tool with the `--3to4` flag.
